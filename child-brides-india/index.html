        <h1>Daughters Not Brides: Child Marriage in India</h1>

        <div class ="divider"></div>
        <p> Child marriage is a human rights violation that affects millions of children worldwide. It is a harmful practice that disproportionately affects younger girls. Although the prevalence rate of child marriage among girls in India stands at 23%, the absolute count conveys a horrifying reality. </p>

        <p> Child marriage is becoming less common in India, but the country still
            accounts for one in three of the worldâ€™s child brides. Child brides include girls under 18 who are already married, as well as women of all ages who first married
            in childhood.</p>

        <h2> Statewise Disparity</h2>
        <p>Child marriage is more prevalent in rural areas than in urban areas. The prevalence of child marriage is highest in the central and western parts of India. </p>
        <img id= "img3" src="images/IndiaMap.png">
        <p>Over half of the girls and women in India who married in childhood live in five states: Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh is home to the largest number.</p>

        <h2>Has the Situation Improved in the Last 15 Years?</h2>
        <p>Educational attainment and economic conditions are significant factors influencing child marriage rates. Lower education levels and poverty are closely linked with higher incidences of child marriage. We compare the drop in risk rates with data from 15 years ago.</p>
